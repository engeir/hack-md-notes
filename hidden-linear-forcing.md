> How does the different forcings relate to the temperature, and does any of them have a

With this, we want to look at how close the different forcings come to forming a linear
relationship with the temperature signal.

## Temperature

Let us first have a look at the temperature response as a deviation from the equilibrium
for three different volcanic eruption strengths.

Now, let us create an equivalent plot for the three different forcing time series.
