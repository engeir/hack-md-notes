## Literature

### 1998 — Lindzen, Giannitsis: On the climatic implications of volcanic cooling

> DOI: [10.1029/98JD00125](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98JD00125)

- Uses 3-box EBM to look at the response to volcanoes under different sensitivities by
  adjusting the coupling between ocean-atmosphere (high sensitivity → weak coupling.)
- In more sensitive climates, ocean play a more important role in leading the system
  back to equilibrium.
- Sensitivity matter less in first year or two, then larger sensitivity give a slower
  recovery to equilibrium than the weak sensitivity case.

### 2005 — Jones et al.: An AOGCM simulation of the climate response to a volcanic super-eruption

> DOI: [10.1007/s00382-005-0066-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-005-0066-8)

- AOD of ~15, similar in size to Toba 72ky ago (two orders of magnitude larger than
  Mount Pinatubo, i.e., Pinatubo volcanic aerosol time 100).

### 2015 — Johansson et al.: Equilibrium climate sensitivity in light of observations over the warming hiatus

> DOI: [10.1038/nclimate2573](https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2573)

- The warming hiatus (1980- and 90s) is primarily attributable to El Niño/Southern
  Oscillation-related variability and reduced solar forcing.
- We suggest that it is too early to conclude that the hiatus has had any particular
  impact on estimates of ECS.

### 2016 — Toohey et al.: Climatic and societal impacts of a volcanic double event at the dawn of the Middle Ages

> DOI: [10.1007/s10584-016-1648-7](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-016-1648-7)

- Might have some interesting data: double volcano event in 536 and 540 CE,

### 2019 — Yang et al.: Climate Impacts From Large Volcanic Eruptions in a High-Resolution Climate Model: The importance of Forcing Structure.\

> DOI: [10.1029/2019GL082367](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082367)

#### Introduction

- Volcanoes impact ENSO, tropical cyclones, NAO and more, but has low signal-to-noise
  ratio or depend on initial state, perhaps even model dependent.
- FLOR coupled climate model, $50\,\mathrm{km}$ horizontal resolution.

#### Questions

- Temperature and precipitation response to different eruptions ((a)symmetric)
- What is the response of TC activity?
- Proportional climate response?

#### Results and discussion

- Pinatubo reduces precipitation over tropics
- Asymmetric reduces where the load is, enhances on opposite hemisphere. Global mean
  somewhat enhanced.
- TAS in high load hemispheres are comparable to Pinatubo
- Stronger impact on precipitation and TC than Pinatubo
- **Transient climate sensitivity is not proportional:** largest from Santa Maria (NH),
  identical from Pinatubo (both) and Agung (SH).
- Usually it is assumed that weaker eruptions have weaker impact, this demonstrates the
  opposite can be the case.
- This highlight **importance of spatial structures**.
- Crucial to obtain an accurate reconstruction of volcanic aerosol radiative property
  spatial structure.

### 2019 — Richardson et al.: Efficacy of Climate Forcings in PDRMIP Models

> DOI: [10.1029/2019JD030581](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD030581)

- No evidence that geographical location of sulfate aerosol affects its efficacy
- Quantifying forcing efficacies and understanding how robust they are across different
  models are of substantial importance
- Compares six different ways of estimating forcing from different forcing agents, and
  evaluates their appropriateness based on the efficacies, which should be unity.
  $\mathrm{ERF}_\mathrm{sst}$ comes out as optimal (effective radiative forcing from
  fixed sea-surface temperature).
- ==Uses large aerosol perturbations, and it is assumed that the temperature response
  scales linearly with forcing strengths. Calls for further studies to explore that.==

### 2020 — Gregory et al.: How accurately can the climate sensitivity to CO~2~ be estimated from historical climate change?

> DOI: [10.1007/s00382-019-04991-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04991-y)

- Volcanic forcing in the mean of CMIP5 is 80% of the AR5 estimate, which is attributed
  to rapid cloud adjustments not included in the AR5 estimate
- For volcanic aerosol, $\alpha$ _may_ be larger than for CO~2~ (EffCS smaller,
  efficacy, less than unity), since regression of $R=F-N$ (annual mean) against $T$ is
  much steeper.
- EffCS is higher when volcanic forcing is relatively less important (see similar trend
  when volcanoes are not present, 1945-1975, and when CO~2~ is dominant, 1975–2005).
- CMIP5 AOGCMs are not realistic in their response to volcanic forcing. In the real
  world, instead of causing a rapid cooling of $T$, volcanoes have the effect of
  "sucking" heat from the ocean beneath.

### 2021 — Pauling et al.: Robust Inter-Hemispheric Asymmetry in the Response to Symmetric Volcanic Forcing in Model Large Ensembles

> DOI: [10.1029/2021GL092558](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL092558)

#### Introduction

- Makes use of CMIP6 to evaluate high-latitude climate response during large eruptions
- Simulations are forced with historical GHG, ozone, solar and aerosol forcing.

#### Results and discussion

- Sea ice volume in CESM2 is much greater and persists longer than in the other models
- Symmetric forcing (Pinatubo) give asymmetry in zonal-mean TAS
- Some ensemble members warm at high latitudes
- ==Robust feature:== The inter-hemispheric asymmetry in the temperature response of the
  climate system response to approximately hemispherically symmetric volcanic forcing
- **Despite the dissimilar physical nature of the forcings, same asymmetric fast
  response to CO2 is what they find here for symmetric volcanic forcing**

### 2022 — Salvi et al.: Interpreting differences in radiative feedbacks from aerosols versus greenhouse gases

> DOI: [10.1029/2022GL097766](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL097766)

- ==Not a consensus on whether $\alpha$ (climate feedback parameter — $N=F-\alpha T$)
  depends on the different forcing agents.==
- Differences in radiative feedback across forcing agents may be explained in terms of
  different tropospheric stability responses and their impact on cloud and lapse-rate
  feedbacks.
- Higher tropospheric stability → low boundary-layer clouds over marine regions
- Low clouds reflect solar → cooling effect on radiation
- Expect a positive correlation between net $\alpha$ and the stability response per unit
  global warming ($\mathrm{d}S/\mathrm{d}T$)
- ==Finally calls for further work to settle disagreement between their and Richardson
  (2019) results (i.e., that aerosols give greater sensitivity than GHG)==

## Original source papers

### 2002 — Soden et al.: Global Cooling After the Eruption of Mount Pinatubo: A Test of Climate Feedback by Water Vapor.\_

> DOI: [10.1126/science.296.5568.727](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.296.5568.727)

#### Water vapour introduction

- They show: without the strong _positive_ feedback from water-vapour, the model is
  unable to reproduce the observed cooling.
- Hence, climate models heavily rely on the water-vapour feedback.
- WV the dominant greenhouse gas and provides the largest feedback for amplifying
  climate change.
- Increases with temperature → doubles the sensitivity of temperature to an increase in
  anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
- If the actual feedback is weaker, uncertainty would be smaller.
- **How well represented is it in climate models?** (Refs. 6 & 7)

#### Role of volcanoes

- Volcanoes provide valuable observations of the system's response (transient) to an
  external radiative forcing. Aerosols spread largely in the lower stratosphere.
- Effective at scattering sunlight, bad at absorbing long wave radiation.
- Mount Pinatubo cooled the lower troposphere → reduction in global water vapour
  concentration.

#### Simulations

- Uses a GCM, mixed-layer ocean.
- Starting 5 months before the eruption, lasting 5 years.
- Three pairs with: control & Mount Pinatubo (observed zonal mean distribution of
  aerosols).
- Data indicate peak 18 months after eruption (0.5 K cooling).

### 2004 — Wigley et al.: Effect of climate sensitivity on the response to volcanic forcing

> DOI: [10.1029/2004JD005557](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004JD005557)

#### Introduction

- Wants to: obtain improved estimate of the underlying response of 20th century global
  mean temperature to volcanic forcing.
- Also use simulations to reduce internally generated noise (16 coupled AOGCM)
- **Maximum cooling depend on sensitivity raised to power 0.37.**
- Temperature relaxes back with $e$-folding time of 29--43 months.
- Pinatubo requires sensitivity above the $1.5^\circ\text{C}$ (lower bound). None of the
  eruptions rule out sensitivity above $4.5^\circ$C.
- Problems when comparing modelled and observed effects are
  1. Poor forcing precision at earlier times
  2. Signal to noise ratio. Response is quick and decays after a relatively short time
  3. Forcing events lasting shorter than 5 years are less sensitive to $\Delta T2x$ than
     longer ones.
  4. Sensitivity may depend on the nature of the forcing and the spatial distribution.
- [LG98](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98JD00125) note that
  response to consecutive eruptions has closer dependence with $\Delta T2x$.
  - 3-box EBM, $400\,$m deep, diffusive ocean

#### Simulations

- Good agreement between MAGICC (model) and AOGCM.
- They quantified relaxation timescales by fitting exponential decay curves.

> DOI: [10.1029/2005GL023542](https://doi.org/10.1029/2005GL023542)

- Simulations of volcanic cooling using a GCM have not been considered to date (2005) as
  a test of climate sensitivity.
- Here, Mt. Pinatubo is simulated with low- and high-sensitivity GCMs (differ in how
  they treat clouds).

### 2006 — Douglass et al.: Thermocline flux exchange during the Pinatubo event

> DOI: [10.1029/2006GL026355](https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL026355)

- Uses EBM with coupling between the mixed layer and the thermocline, exponential, exact
  solutions, exponential, exact solutions
- Get a short response time of $\tau=4.4\mathrm{months}$
- _Pinatubo: $0.5\circ\mathrm{C}$ cooling and $4\,\mathrm{W/m^2}$ decrease in outgoing
  longwave radiation_
- $7.6$ months; peak of aerosol forcing

### 2007 — Boer et al.: Inferring climate sensitivity from volcanic events

> DOI: [10.1007/s00382-006-0193-x](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-006-0193-x)

- For volcano-like forcing the global mean surface temperature responses of the models
  are very similar, despite their differing equilibrium climate sensitivities,
  indicating that climate sensitivity cannot be inferred from the temperature record
  alone even if the forcing is known.
- The overall conclusion is that climate sensitivity cannot be inferred directly from
  the global average temperature response to volcano-like forcing even if the forcing is
  known. An independent knowledge of the heat penetration into the deep ocean is
  required.
- One possibility is that the real climate system operates in a manner similar to the
  slab ocean model (rather than the full ocean model).
- The experiments support the possibility of inferring the climate sensitivity of the
  real system by studying the impact of volcanoes provided that both the forcing and the
  heat storage in the system are known with sufficient accuracy.

- NH extra-tropical eruptions tend to exhibit smaller effective radii than tropical
  eruptison for a given SO~2~ erupted mass

> DOI: [10.1038/nature14565](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14565)

- The findings indicate that eruption-induced climate anomalies following large tropical
  eruptions may last longer than is indicated in many climate simulations (<3–5 years).
- They suggest that potential positive feedbacks initiated after large tropical
  eruptions (for example, sea-ice feedbacks) may not be adequately represented in
  climate simulations.

- Forcing that project more strongly on the Northern Hemisphere are more effective at
  changing temperatures than CO~2~.
- =='historical-misc' archive includes 1850--2005 runs of single forcings, including
  volcanic forcing.==
- The use of effective (rather than instantaneous) radiative forcing may render the
  sensitivities from GHG-only and historical simulations more directly comparable.

> DOI: [10.1002/2016GL067935](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016GL067935)

- CMIP5 indicate that models overestimate the magnitude of the global temperature
  response to volcanic eruptions (sampling issue, eruptions coincided with El Niño
  events).
- When they explicitly account for the effects of internal variability, the GMST
  response to volcanic eruptions is consistent, within uncertainties, between models and
  observations. This holds in particular for the coincidence of El Niño events (be it by
  chance or due to an eruption triggering an El Niño event).
- **Subject of ongoing research:** how (and if) Southern Annular Mode is confounded by
  superposition of eruptions and El Niño events.

### 2016 — Gregory et al.: Small global-mean cooling due to volcanic radiative forcing

> DOI: [10.1007/s00382-016-3055-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3055-1)

- Relation between aerosol optical depth and radiative forcing (in
  $\text{W}\text{m}^{-2}$) show a linear trend (fig. 4)
- Their zero layer model overestimate the sudden cooling in the AOGCMs from short-lived
  large negative forcing from volcanic eruptions. Assumed to be due to the zero layer
  model neglecting upper-layer heat capacity. **Thus, difference in CO2 vs. volcano
  forcing is not the sign, but the timescale**.
- Would be useful for investigation of volcanic forcing and feedback in CMIP6 if
  ensemble experiments had only historical aerosol forcing, to diagnose the climate
  response. Further, with AGCMs with prescribed sea surface conditions, to diagnose the
  radiative forcing.
  - _Do other models also exhibit a cloud adjustment and a lower climate sensitivity for
    volcanic forcing?_

### 2016 — Santer et al.: Volcanic effects on climate

> DOI: [10.1038/nclimate2859](https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2859)

- Uncertainties in $\Delta T_{(t)}^{\mathrm{Vol}}$ are larger than what reported by
  Johansson et al. (2015).
- El Niño in 1980- and 90s masks cooling from El Chichón and Pinatubo and hamper
  reliable estimation of the true cooling signal.
- Concerning that Johansson et al. infer a posterior average estimate of
  $F^{\mathrm{Pn}}$ that is substantially smaller than that obtained from observations.

### 2016 — Lovejoy and Varotsos: Scaling regimes and linear/nonlinear responses of last millennium climate to volcanic and solar forcings

> DOI: [10.5194/esd-7-133-2016](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-133-2016)

- One study suggested that volcanic forcing never equilibrates (too little time in
  between eruptions, eruptions occur over all observed timescales)
- Volcanic forcings was seen to be strong at annual scales but decreasing ($H<0$) while
  the solar forcing was small at annual scales and increasing ($H>0$)

### 2016 — Rypdal and Rypdal: Late Quaternary temperature variability described as abrupt transitions on a $1/f$ noise background

> DOI: [10.5194/esd-7-281-2016](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-281-2016)

- The $1/f$ noise characterization of the temporal fluctuations in global mean surface
  temperature is robust — accurate for the Holocene climate
- Processes that exhibit power-law structure functions and strictly concave scaling
  functions can be characterized as multifractal intermittent
- For a monofractal (monoscaling) process, the scaling function is linear in
- The analysis give no evidence of multifractal intermittency in the temperature records
- Multifractal intermittency implies that amplitudes of random fluctuations are
  clustered in time on all timescales (e.g., intermittent turbulence). This is not
  observed here, most reasonably modelled as monofractals

### 2016 — Rypdal and Rypdal: Comment on “Scaling regimes and linear/nonlinear responses of last millennium climate to volcanic and solar forcings" by S. Lovejoy and C. Varotsos (2016)

> DOI: [10.5194/esd-7-597-2016](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-597-2016)

- The question is not whether non-linearities are present in the Zebiak-Cane or GCM
  models (it is), but whether these non-linearities are detectable in the global
  temperature response
- No reason why responses should be more linear on short than on long timescales, in
  particular not the response to burst-like volcanic forcing

### 2017 — Knutti et al.: Beyond equilibrium climate sensitivity

> DOI: [10.1038/ngeo3017](https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo3017)

- “But even more pressing are the debates about fair contributions for each country in
  reducing emissions, helping others to do so, and adapt, and the lack of willingness to
  step up and lead the pack.”
- Discrepancy and lack of progress? Models favour ECS in the upper part of the “likely”
  range.
- Big concern that many climate models share the same limitations, same imperfect
  observations
- Clouds are the largest uncertainty feedback
- Easier to produce a model with good performance on mean climate and a climate
  sensitivity above the IPCC range
- Uncertainties also in observations, making even multidecadal trends uncertain
- _Most pressing issue:_ Growing concern that a single constant climate feedback
  parameter (λ) is unrealistic. Neglects differences in the temperature response to
  forcing that are not captured by a forcing efficacy.
- Therefore, ECS also (including TCR) depend strongly on ocean heat uptake and
  circulation response
- Forcings may not be additive, but depend on the type and magnitude of the forcing
- ECS estimates assuming a constant λ are probably underestimates

### 2018 — Sukhodolov et al.: Stratospheric aerosol evolution after Pinatubo simulated with a coupled size-resolved aerosol-chemistry-climate model, SOCOL-AERv1.0

> DOI: [10.5194/gmd-11-2633-2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2633-2018)

- An intercomparison revealed that modelled volcanic sulphate deposition varies
  substantially in timing, spatial pattern, and magnitude between the models
- Still no clear understanding of which model is closer to reality in describing the
  stratospheric aerosol distribution
- Even with a fine aerosol size resolution, resulting sedimentation can be biased due to
  the model’s numerical scheme
- There is rising interest among the climate community in global models with interactive
  aerosol microphysics, partly because of the unclear role of major and smaller
  volcanoes in the future climate (e.g., Bethke et al., 2017; Klobas et al., 2017)
