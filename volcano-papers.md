### Water vapour introduction

- They show: without the strong _positive_ feedback from water-vapour, the model is
  unable to reproduce the observed cooling.
- Hence, climate models heavily rely on the water-vapour feedback.
- WV the dominant greenhouse gas and provides the largest feedback for amplifying
  climate change.
- Increases with temperature → doubles the sensitivity of temperature to an increase in
  anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
- If the actual feedback is weaker, uncertainty would be smaller.
- __How well represented is it in climate models?__ (Refs. 6 & 7)

### Role of volcanoes

- Volcanoes provide valuable observations of the system's response (transient) to an
  external radiative forcing. Aerosols spread largely in the lower stratosphere.
- Effective at scattering sunlight, bad at absorbing long wave radiation.
- Mount Pinatubo cooled the lower troposphere → reduction in global water vapour
  concentration.

### Simulations

- Uses a GCM, mixed-layer ocean.
- Starting 5 months before the eruption, lasting 5 years.
- Three pairs with: control & Mount Pinatubo (observed zonal mean distribution of
  aerosols).
- Data indicate peak 18 months after eruption (0.5 K cooling).

## 2004 — Wigley et al.: Effect of climate sensitivity on the response to volcanic forcing

> DOI: [10.1029/2004JD005557](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004JD005557)

### Introduction

- Wants to: obtain improved estimate of the underlying response of 20th century global
  mean temperature to volcanic forcing.
- Also use simulations to reduce internally generated noise (16 coupled AOGCM)
- __Maximum cooling depend on sensitivity raised to power 0.37.__
- Temperature relaxes back with $e$-folding time of 29--43 months.
- Pinatubo requires sensitivity above the $1.5^\circ\text{C}$ (lower bound). None of the
  eruptions rule out sensitivity above $4.5^\circ$C.
- Problems when comparing modelled and observed effects are
  1. Poor forcing precision at earlier times
  2. Signal to noise ratio. Response is quick and decays after a relatively short time
  3. Forcing events lasting shorter than 5 years are less sensitive to $\Delta T2x$ than
     longer ones.
  4. Sensitivity may depend on the nature of the forcing and the spatial distribution.
- [LG98](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98JD00125) note that
  response to consecutive eruptions has closer dependence with $\Delta T2x$.
  - 3-box EBM, $400\,$m deep, diffusive ocean

### Simulations

- Good agreement between MAGICC (model) and AOGCM.
- They quantified relaxation timescales by fitting exponential decay curves.

## 1998 — Lindzen, Giannitsis: On the climatic implications of volcanic cooling

- Uses 3-box EBM to look at the response to volcanoes under different sensitivities by
  adjusting the coupling between ocean-atmosphere (high sensitivity → weak coupling.)
- In more sensitive climates, ocean play a more important role in leading the system
  back to equilibrium.
- Sensitivity matter less in first year or two, then larger sensitivity give a slower
  recovery to equilibrium than the weak sensitivity case.

## 2016 — Ollila: Climate Sensitivity Parameter in the Test of the Mount Pinatubo Eruption

> DOI: [10.9734/PSIJ/2016/23242](https://doi.org/10.9734/PSIJ/2016/23242)
  ([PDF](https://www.academia.edu/download/48400134/Ollila-Pinatubo_eruption.pdf))

- Time constants for the ocean of $2.74$ months and for the land of $1.04$ months are
  accurate and applicable in the dynamic analysis.

- CMIP5 indicate that models overestimate the magnitude of the global temperature
  response to volcanic eruptions (sampling issue, eruptions coincided with El Niño
  events).
- When they explicitly account for the effects of internal variability, the GMST
  response to volcanic eruptions is consistent, within uncertainties, between models and
  observations. This holds in particular for the coincidence of El Niño events (be it by
  chance or due to an eruption triggering an El Niño event).
- __Subject of ongoing research:__ how (and if) Southern Annular Mode is confounded by
  superposition of eruptions and El Niño events.

## 2016 — Gregory: Small global-mean cooling due to volcanic radiative forcing

> DOI: [10.1007/s00382-016-3055-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3055-1)

- Relation between aerosol optical depth and radiative forcing (in
  $\text{W}\text{m}^{-2}$) show a linear trend (fig. 4)
- Their zero layer model overestimate the sudden cooling in the AOGCMs from short-lived
  large negative forcing from volcanic eruptions. Assumed to be due to the zero layer
  model neglecting upper-layer heat capacity. __Thus, difference in CO2 vs. volcano
  forcing is not the sign, but the timescale__.
- Would be useful for investigation of volcanic forcing and feedback in CMIP6 if
  ensemble experiments had only historical aerosol forcing, to diagnose the climate
  response. Further, with AGCMs with prescribed sea surface conditions, to diagnose the
  radiative forcing.
  - _Do other models also exhibit a cloud adjustment and a lower climate sensitivity for
    volcanic forcing?_

- AOD of ~15, similar in size to Toba 72ky ago (two orders of magnitude larger than
  Mount Pinatubo, i.e., Pinatubo volcanic aerosol time 100).

### Introduction

- Volcanoes impact ENSO, tropical cyclones, NAO and more, but has low signal-to-noise
  ratio or depend on initial state, perhaps even model dependent.
- FLOR coupled climate model, $50\,\mathrm{km}$ horizontal resolution.

### Questions

- Temperature and precipitation response to different eruptions ((a)symmetric)
- What is the response of TC activity?
- Proportional climate response?

### Results and discussion

- Pinatubo reduces precipitation over tropics
- Asymmetric reduces where the load is, enhances on opposite hemisphere. Global mean
  somewhat enhanced.
- TAS in high load hemispheres are comparable to Pinatubo
- Stronger impact on precipitation and TC than Pinatubo
- __Transient climate sensitivity is not proportional:__ largest from Santa Maria (NH),
  identical from Pinatubo (both) and Agung (SH).
- Usually it is assumed that weaker eruptions have weaker impact, this demonstrates the
  opposite can be the case.
- This highlight __importance of spatial structures__.
- Crucial to obtain an accurate reconstruction of volcanic aerosol radiative property
  spatial structure.

## 2021 — Pauling et al.: Robust Inter-Hemispheric Asymmetry in the Response to Symmetric Volcanic Forcing in Model Large Ensembles

> DOI: [10.1029/2021GL092558](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL092558)

### Introduction

- Makes use of CMIP6 to evaluate high-latitude climate response during large eruptions
- Simulations are forced with historical GHG, ozone, solar and aerosol forcing.

### Results and discussion

- Sea ice volume in CESM2 is much greater and persists longer than in the other models
- Symmetric forcing (Pinatubo) give asymmetry in zonal-mean TAS
- Some ensemble members warm at high latitudes
- __Robust feature:__ The inter-hemispheric asymmetry in the temperature response of the
  climate system response to approximately hemispherically symmetric volcanic forcing
- __Despite the dissimilar physical nature of the forcings, same asymmetric fast
  response to CO2 is what they find here for symmetric volcanic forcing__
