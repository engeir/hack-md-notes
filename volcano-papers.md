## Literature

### 1998 — Lindzen, Giannitsis: On the climatic implications of volcanic cooling

> DOI:
> [10.1029/98JD00125](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98JD00125)

- Uses 3-box EBM to look at the response to volcanoes under different sensitivities by
  adjusting the coupling between ocean-atmosphere (high sensitivity → weak coupling.)
- In more sensitive climates, the ocean plays a more important role in leading the
  system back to equilibrium.
- Sensitivity matter less in the first year or two, then larger sensitivity gives a
  slower recovery to equilibrium than the weak sensitivity case.

### 2005 — Hansen et al.: Efficacy of climate forcings

> DOI: [10.1029/2005JD005776](https://doi.org/10.1029/2005JD005776)

- Wishes to compare the efficacy of different climate forcings, where ideally they all
  have the same efficacy of one
- The efficacy is defined as the global temperature response per unit forcing relative
  to the response to CO2 forcing

### 2005 — Jones et al.: An AOGCM simulation of the climate response to a volcanic super-eruption

> DOI: [10.1007/s00382-005-0066-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-005-0066-8)

- The first coupled model simulation of a generic volcanic super-eruption
- Examined the response to a maximum stratospheric loading of $1.4\,\mathrm{Gt}$
  ($=1400\,\mathrm{Mt}=1400\,\mathrm{Tg}$) of sulphate aerosols
- AOD of $\sim 15$, similar in size to Toba 72ky ago (two orders of magnitude larger
  than Mount Pinatubo, i.e., Pinatubo volcanic aerosol times 100).
- Maximum radiation TOA imbalance of $-60\,\mathrm{Wm^{-2}}$
- A maximum temperature fall of $10.7\,\mathrm{K}$, $9.4\,\mathrm{K}$ for the maximum
  annual mean
- Albedo increase from $0.3$ to $0.7$
- They used HadCM3, with the optical depth values input into the model as monthly
  quarterspheric values
- Within the model, the sulphuric acid mass was calculated and distributed evenly above
  the model tropopause
- Since they use aerosol concentrations of $100\times$Pinatubo, any non-linear chemical
  processes that may occur will not be included
- For example, the highest level in HadCM3 is $5\,\mathrm{hPa}$ ($\sim
  30\,\mathrm{km}$), but a plume from a super-eruption could possibly reach above
  $40\,\mathrm{km}$
- ==Encourage more work on expanding our knowledge of past volcanic eruptions and their
  impact on the environment==

### 2008 — Gao et al.: Volcanic forcing of climate over the past 1500 years: An improved ice core-based index for climate models

> DOI: [10.1029/2008JD010239](https://doi.org/10.1029/2008JD010239)

- Gives an updated time series of the last 1500 years of volcanic forcing
- The output is made to be _total stratospheric volcanic sulphate aerosol injection_, in
  units of Tg, Terra gram
- ==Converting from $\mathrm{Tg}$ to $\mathrm{W/m^2}$, i.e., what is usually used as
  forcing==: (paragraph 17)
  1. Divide the loading by $1.5\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{Tg}$ to obtain optical depth
  2. Multiply optical depth by $20$ to obtain the radiative forcing in $\mathrm{W/m^2}$

### 2009 — Timmreck et al.: Limited temperature response to the very large AD 1258 volcanic eruption

> DOI: [10.1029/2009GL040083](https://doi.org/10.1029/2009GL040083)

- ==Examines the climate response as a function of aerosol size==
- The 1258 eruption had ten times as much stratospheric sulphate load as Pinatubo, but
  the temperature response does not compare
- Larger particles scatter less visible light and absorb more efficiently in the near-
  and far-infrared
- Uses the MPI-M model
- Forcing is AOD at 550 nm specified on four equal-area latitude bands
- The find no significant difference in the greenhouse effect, but the albedo effect is
  strongly modulated
- Larger particles are removed more quickly (due to gravity), but an opposing effect
  that might occur is that OH radicals are depleted and the conversion rate from SO~2~
  to sulphuric acid vapour is reduced, which would impede (get in the way of; hinder)
  the growth of aerosol particles and prolong their atmospheric lifetime

### 2010 — Timmreck et al.: Aerosol size confines climate response to volcanic super‐eruptions

> DOI: [10.1029/2010GL045464](https://doi.org/10.1029/2010GL045464)

**Take away:** Global mean temperature anomalies (from YTT) are three times weaker than
previously suggested.

- Two more recent simulations with coupled atmosphere-ocean models calculated a decade
  of severe cooling of up to $-10\,\mathrm{K}$ (global mean) for a Toba simulation
  comparable to 100 times Pinatubo.
- _For estimating the climatic consequences of large volcanic eruptions, the
  stratospheric sulphur (S) emission of the erupting magma is of central importance._
  (Estimates vary with more than one order of magnitude.)
- Immediately after the eruption:
  1. SO~2~ is oxidized into condensable H~2~SO~4~ vapour (SO~2~ oxidation is delayed
     when compared with the evolution after the much weaker 1991 Pinatubo eruption due
     to the limiting factor of OH-abundance)
  2. After the maximum size is reached (about one year after the eruption), rapid
     sedimentation of large aerosol particles occurs, so AOD is already at background
     levels by year four (smaller than the lifetime given by Bekki of ten years)
- In all ensemble members, maximum cooling is much smaller and of considerably shorter
  duration than reported in former model studies. Previous studies have:
  - $-3.5\,\mathrm{K}$ cooling but a prolonged cooling response
  - $-10\,\mathrm{K}$ cooling but back to normal well within a decade
- Advection of mild moist air from the Atlantic overrides the effect of radiative
  cooling in this region (northern Eurasia), something that has been observed after most
  historic volcanic eruptions
- A more complete treatment of stratospheric aerosol formation and growth lead to much
  weaker radiative forcing due to larger particle sizes and faster removal rate
- The global distribution of temperature anomalies is highly dependent on the initial
  state of the Pacific

### 2012 — Rypdal, K., Global temperature response to radiative forcing: Solar cycle versus volcanic eruptions

> DOI: [10.1029/2011JD017283](https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JD017283)

**Take away:** An overview of simple EBMs and how well-suited they are to represent the
GMST from 1880 to 2010.

- $-\lambda^{-1}\Delta T$ (he uses $\lambda=S_\mathrm{eq}$) represents the change of
  flux of infrared radiation in response to the temperature change $\Delta T$
- The parameter $\lambda$ measures how much the equilibrium temperature $\Delta
  T_\mathrm{eq}$ changes in response to a forcing perturbation $\Delta F$, and is
  therefore called the climate sensitivity
- _Explanation of "warming in the pipeline"_
- _Why the temperature response to volcanic eruptions represent a useful tool to
  determine the sensitivity and time constant_
- The mismatch in spectral index as well as in amplitude, clearly indicates that the
  climate noise is internally generated and not a response to fluctuations in solar
  forcing
- Inferring sensitivity and time constants from MLE is misleading since it assumes a
  model in which white noise is used to represent internal variability, but the
  fluctuations in the climate system is not white noise
- The MLE approach is futile (with some restrictions)
- (In support of the scale-free response.) Before dismissing the idea of a scale-free
  response one should not forget that eq.(1) is derived without taking into account slow
  feedback. The temperature that was in equilibrium with the forcing a few decades ago
  is not in equilibrium with the same forcing today. A measure of climate sensitivity as
  a single parameter may make little sense

### 2015 — Johansson et al.: Equilibrium climate sensitivity in light of observations over the warming hiatus

> DOI: [10.1038/nclimate2573](https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2573)

- The warming hiatus (1980s and 90s) is primarily attributable to El Niño/Southern
  Oscillation-related variability and reduced solar forcing.
- We suggest that it is too early to conclude that the hiatus has had any particular
  impact on estimates of ECS.

### 2016 — Toohey et al.: Climatic and societal impacts of a volcanic double event at the dawn of the Middle Ages

> DOI: [10.1007/s10584-016-1648-7](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-016-1648-7)

- Uses the MAECHAM5-HAM model, which takes emissions from AEROCOM(?) (see [this
  paper](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/5/1125/2005/acp-5-1125-2005.pdf), [Timmreck
  et al. (2010)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2010GL045464)
  also use that emission source). Combines this with MPI-ESM
  ([source](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jame.20038)).
- Might have some interesting data: double volcano event in 536 and 540 CE.
- Single events were not large compared to the last about 2000 years, but their combined
  response was the largest within that same time period.
- Found that the impact of the first extra-tropical eruption was not minor compared to
  the second tropical eruption, opposite to most other studies.
- Found indications of prolonged impacts of the eruptions on decade-length scales in
  Arctic sea-ice production.

### 2018 — Marshall et al.: Multi-model comparison of the volcanic sulfate deposition from the 1815 eruption of Mt. Tambora

> DOI: [10.5194/acp-18-2307-2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-2307-2018)

- CESM1(WACCM) starts spreading at a later time, and the sulfate stays for longer
- Aerosol formation and growth are simulated through parametrizations of nucleation,
  condensation and coagulation
- Modal aerosol schemes represent aerosol particle size distribution by several
  log-normal modes
- Transport of stratospheric aerosols happens through sedimentation and large-scale
  circulation by the Brewer-Dobson circulation
- The QBO is nudged (by CESM1(WACCM))
- Dry deposition schemes are resistance-based and wet deposition is parametrized based
  on model precipitation and convective processes
- Aerosol removal is calculated via first-order loss processes representing in-cloud and
  below-cloud scavenging
- CESM1(WACCM) includes interactive hydroxyl radical (OH) chemistry, allowing OH
  concentrations to evolve throughout the simulations (MAECHAM5-HAM does not have this,
  which is why SO2 levels peak earlier)
- The Brewer-Dobson circulation is stronger during winter, therefore the transport to
  the SH of sulfate aerosols is stronger than the transport to the NH
- In CESM1(WACCM) the poleward transport of volcanic aerosol may be too weak or
  midlatitude deposition too strong
- CESM1(WACCM) has the strongest polar jets, which may affect the polar sulfate
  deposition, but it appears to be a combination of factors
- Scavenging and deposition parametrizations are highly uncertain, especially as the
  eruptions become larger

### 2019 — Yang et al.: Climate Impacts From Large Volcanic Eruptions in a High-Resolution Climate Model: The importance of Forcing Structure

> DOI: [10.1029/2019GL082367](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082367)

**Take away:** Different sensitivity from different volcanic forcings, spatial structure
matter

Introduction

- Volcanoes impact ENSO, ITCZ (intertropical convergence zone) tropical cyclones, NAO
  (North Atlantic Oscillation) and more, but has low signal-to-noise ratio or depend on
  initial state, perhaps even model dependent.
- FLOR coupled climate model, $50\,\mathrm{km}$ horizontal resolution.

Questions

- Temperature and precipitation response to different eruptions ((a)symmetric)
- What is the response to TC activity?
- Proportional climate response?

Results and discussion

- Pinatubo reduces precipitation over the tropics
- Asymmetric reduces where the load is, enhances on the opposite hemisphere. Global mean
  somewhat enhanced.
- TAS in high-load hemispheres are comparable to Pinatubo
- Stronger impact on precipitation and TC than Pinatubo
- ==Transient climate sensitivity is not proportional:== largest from Santa Maria (NH),
  identical from Pinatubo (both) and Agung (SH).
- Usually, it is assumed that weaker eruptions have a weaker impact, this demonstrates
  the opposite can be the case.
- This highlight ==importance of spatial structures==.
- Crucial to obtaining an accurate reconstruction of volcanic aerosol radiative property
  spatial structure.

### 2019 — Richardson et al.: Efficacy of Climate Forcings in PDRMIP Models

> DOI: [10.1029/2019JD030581](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD030581)

**Take away:** Forcing behaves similarly across agents

- No evidence that the geographical location of sulfate aerosol affects its efficacy
- Quantifying forcing efficacies and understanding how robust they are across different
  models are of substantial importance
- Compares six different ways of estimating forcing from different forcing agents, and
  evaluates their appropriateness based on the efficacies, which should be unity.
  $\mathrm{ERF}_\mathrm{sst}$ comes out as optimal (effective radiative forcing from
  fixed sea-surface temperature).
- ==Uses large aerosol perturbations, and it is assumed that the temperature response
  scales linearly with forcing strengths. Calls for further studies to explore that.==

### 2019 — Zanchettin et al.: Clarifying the Relative Role of Forcing Uncertainties and Initial-Condition Unknowns in Spreading the Climate Response to Volcanic Eruptions

> DOI: [10.1029/2018GL081018](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081018)

- Want to answer the question "Is constraining the magnitude of forcing estimates more
  important than constraining initial conditions to be able to accurately simulate the
  climate response to a specific volcanic eruption?"
- Initial conditions can dominate the global mean temperature response from volcanic
  eruptions compared to different realistic choices on its magnitude
- A big summer-winter asymmetry in the ensemble spread of posteruption anomalies,
  reflecting a prominent contribution of internal dynamics to the winter response

### 2020 — Gregory et al.: How accurately can the climate sensitivity to CO~2~ be estimated from historical climate change?

> DOI: [10.1007/s00382-019-04991-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04991-y)

- Volcanic forcing in the mean of CMIP5 is 80% of the AR5 estimate, which is attributed
  to rapid cloud adjustments not included in the AR5 estimate
- For volcanic aerosol, $\alpha$ _may_ be larger than for CO~2~ (EffCS smaller,
  efficacy, less than unity), since regression of $R=F-N$ (annual mean) against $T$ is
  much steeper.
- EffCS is higher when volcanic forcing is relatively less important (see a similar
  trend when volcanoes are not present, 1945-1975, and when CO~2~ is dominant,
  1975–2005).
- CMIP5 AOGCMs are not realistic in their response to volcanic forcing. In the real
  world, instead of causing a rapid cooling of $T$, volcanoes have the effect of
  "sucking" heat from the ocean beneath.

### 2021 — Pauling et al.: Robust Inter-Hemispheric Asymmetry in the Response to Symmetric Volcanic Forcing in Model Large Ensembles

> DOI: [10.1029/2021GL092558](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GL092558)

**Take away:** Despite the different nature of the forcings, CO~2~ and an almost
symmetrical Pinatubo-like volcanic eruption both give a similar asymmetrical response in
the climate system

Introduction

- Makes use of CMIP6 to evaluate high-latitude climate response during large eruptions
- Simulations are forced with historical GHG, ozone, solar and aerosol forcing.

Results and discussion

- Sea ice volume in CESM2 is much greater and persists longer than in the other models
- Symmetric forcing (Pinatubo) gives asymmetry in zonal-mean TAS
- Some ensemble members warm at high latitudes
- ==Robust feature:== The inter-hemispheric asymmetry in the temperature response of the
  climate system response to approximately hemispherically symmetric volcanic forcing
- ==Despite the dissimilar physical nature of the forcings, the same asymmetric fast
  response to CO2 is what they find here for symmetric volcanic forcing==

### 2022 — Salvi et al.: Interpreting differences in radiative feedbacks from aerosols versus greenhouse gases

> DOI: [10.1029/2022GL097766](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL097766)

**Take away:** Aerosols produce more amplifying climate feedback (greater climate
sensitivity) than CO~2~ does, in contrast to Richardson (2019)

- ==Not a consensus on whether $\alpha$ (climate feedback parameter — $N=F-\alpha T$)
  depends on the different forcing agents.==
- Differences in radiative feedback across forcing agents may be explained in terms of
  different tropospheric stability responses and their impact on cloud and lapse-rate
  feedback.
- Higher tropospheric stability → low boundary-layer clouds over marine regions
- Low clouds reflect solar → cooling effect on radiation
- Expect a positive correlation between net $\alpha$ and the stability response per unit
  global warming ($\mathrm{d}S/\mathrm{d}T$)
- ==Finally calls for further work to settle the disagreement between their and the
  Richardson (2019) results (i.e., that aerosols give greater sensitivity than GHG)==
  (also in contrast to Pauling (2021) it seems?)

### 2022 — Chen et al.: Modulating and Resetting Impacts of Different Volcanic Eruptions on North Atlantic SST Variations

> DOI: [10.1029/2021JD036246](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JD036246)

- Volcanic eruptions a pacemaker for the phase transition of SST
- From Mann et al. (2021), volcanoes are the main driver of 40- to 60-year variability
  of SST over NA
- Discusses volcanic impact on the deep ocean:
  Strong volcanoes (at least more than $50\,\mathrm{Tg}$, but should be more than
  $100\,\mathrm{Tg}$) can strengthen the AMOC which subsequently cools the deep ocean

### 2022 — Lin et al.: Magnitude frequency and climate forcing of global volcanism during the last glacial period as seen in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores (60-9 ka)

> DOI: [10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0306.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0306.1)

- **Overall feedback is close to one, but this is because of compensation: early, the
  feedback is strong, while later the feedback is weak**

## Original papers

### 2002 — Soden et al.: Global Cooling After the Eruption of Mount Pinatubo: A Test of Climate Feedback by Water Vapor

> DOI: [10.1126/science.296.5568.727](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.296.5568.727)

Water vapour introduction

- They show: without strong _positive_ feedback from water-vapour, the model is unable
  to reproduce the observed cooling.
- Hence, climate models heavily rely on water-vapour feedback.
- WV is the dominant greenhouse gas and provides the largest feedback for amplifying
  climate change.
- Increases with temperature → doubles the sensitivity of temperature to an increase in
  anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
- If the actual feedback is weaker, uncertainty would be smaller.
- **How well-represented is it in climate models?** (Refs. 6 & 7)

Role of volcanoes

- Volcanoes provide valuable observations of the system's response (transient) to
  external radiative forcing. Aerosols spread largely in the lower stratosphere.
- Effective at scattering sunlight, bad at absorbing long wave radiation.
- Mount Pinatubo cooled the lower troposphere → reduction in global water vapour
  concentration.

Simulations

- Uses a GCM, mixed-layer ocean.
- Starting 5 months before the eruption, and lasting 5 years.
- Three pairs with control & Mount Pinatubo (observed zonal mean distribution of
  aerosols).
- Data indicate peak 18 months after the eruption (0.5 K cooling).

### 2005 — Wigley et al.: Effect of climate sensitivity on the response to volcanic forcing

> DOI: [10.1029/2004JD005557](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2004JD005557)

Introduction

- Wants to: obtain an improved estimate of the underlying response of 20th-century
  global mean temperature to volcanic forcing.
- Also, use simulations to reduce internally generated noise (16 coupled AOGCM)
- **Maximum cooling depends on sensitivity raised to power 0.37.**
- Temperature relaxes back with $e$-folding time of 29--43 months.
- Pinatubo requires sensitivity above the $1.5^\circ\text{C}$ (lower bound). None of the
  eruptions rule out sensitivity above $4.5^\circ$C.
- Problems when comparing modelled and observed effects are
  1. Poor forcing precision at earlier times
  2. Signal-to-noise ratio. The response is quick and decays after a relatively short
     time
  3. Forcing events lasting shorter than 5 years are less sensitive to $\Delta T2x$ than
     longer ones.
  4. Sensitivity may depend on the nature of the forcing and the spatial distribution.
- [LG98](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98JD00125) note that
  response to consecutive eruptions has closer dependence with $\Delta T2x$.
  - 3-box EBM, $400\,$m deep, diffusive ocean

Simulations

- Good agreement between MAGICC (model) and AOGCM.
- They quantified relaxation timescales by fitting exponential decay curves.

> DOI: [10.1029/2005GL023542](https://doi.org/10.1029/2005GL023542)

- Simulations of volcanic cooling using a GCM have not been considered to date (2005) as
  a test of climate sensitivity.
- Here, Mt. Pinatubo is simulated with low- and high-sensitivity GCMs (differ in how
  they treat clouds).

### 2006 — Douglass et al.: Thermocline flux exchange during the Pinatubo event

> DOI: [10.1029/2006GL026355](https://doi.org/10.1029/2006GL026355)

- Uses EBM with coupling between the mixed layer and the thermocline, exponential, exact
  solutions, exponential, exact solutions
- Get a short response time of $\tau=4.4\mathrm{months}$
- _Pinatubo: $0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cooling and $4\,\mathrm{W/m^2}$ decrease in outgoing
  longwave radiation_
- $7.6$ months; peak of aerosol forcing

### 2007 — Boer et al.: Inferring climate sensitivity from volcanic events

> DOI: [10.1007/s00382-006-0193-x](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-006-0193-x)

- For volcano-like forcing the global mean surface temperature responses of the models
  are very similar, despite their differing equilibrium climate sensitivities,
  indicating that climate sensitivity cannot be inferred from the temperature record
  alone even if the forcing is known.
- The overall conclusion is that climate sensitivity cannot be inferred directly from
  the global average temperature response to volcano-like forcing even if the forcing is
  known. An independent knowledge of the heat penetration into the deep ocean is
  required.
- One possibility is that the real climate system operates like the slab ocean model
  (rather than the full ocean model).
- The experiments support the possibility of inferring the climate sensitivity of the
  real system by studying the impact of volcanoes provided that both the forcing and the

- The findings indicate that eruption-induced climate anomalies following large tropical
  eruptions may last longer than is indicated in many climate simulations (<3–5 years).
- They suggest that potential positive feedback initiated after large tropical eruptions
  (for example, sea-ice feedback) may not be adequately represented in climate
  simulations.

- Forcing that projects more strongly on the Northern Hemisphere are more effective at
  changing temperatures than CO~2~.
- =='historical-misc' archive includes 1850--2005 runs of single forcings, including
  volcanic forcing.==
- The use of effective (rather than instantaneous) radiative forcing may render the
  sensitivities from GHG-only and historical simulations more directly comparable.

> DOI: [10.1002/2016GL067935](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016GL067935)

- CMIP5 indicates that models overestimate the magnitude of the global temperature
  response to volcanic eruptions (sampling issue, eruptions coincided with El Niño
  events).
- When they explicitly account for the effects of internal variability, the GMST
  response to volcanic eruptions is consistent, within uncertainties, between models and
  observations. This holds in particular for the coincidence of El Niño events (be it by
  chance or due to an eruption triggering an El Niño event).
- **The subject of ongoing research:** how (and if) Southern Annular Mode is confounded by
  superposition of eruptions and El Niño events.

> Answer: what is the main goal, why do they not include annual mean temperature against
> forcing? They look for different reasons why the cooling is smaller than expected. So,
> maybe it would be a bit counter-intuitive to look at total temperature against
> forcing? No wait, they actually do. Fig. 6. They get from volcanoes $F=-2.7\pm0.1\\,
> \mathrm{W/m^2}$, while the abrupt 4xCO2 give $F=7.7\\,\mathrm{W/m^2}$.

- Relation between aerosol optical depth and radiative forcing (in
  $\text{W}\text{m}^{-2}$) show a linear trend (fig. 4)
- TCRP - Transient Climate Response Parameter: The increase in global-mean temperature
  per unit increase in radiative force during time-dependent climate change
- Their zero layer model overestimates the sudden cooling in the AOGCMs from short-lived
  large negative forcing from volcanic eruptions. Assumed to be due to the zero-layer
  model neglecting upper-layer heat capacity. **Thus, the difference in CO2 vs. volcano
  forcing is not the sign, but the timescale**. The TCRP and the zero-layer model is not
  applicable.
- Two common issues: the forcing $F$ due to volcanoes is not diagnosed (i.e., no fixed
  SST run is done), and $\alpha$ might not be the same as it is for $\mathrm{CO_2}$
- When analysing ocean heat uptake they use a step model which relies on the assumption
  that the response of the system depends linearly on the forcing
- Regression of $F$ against AOD gives a slope of $-24.6\pm0.2$ for AR5
- Confirms that the smaller climate sensitivity to volcanic forcing during the
  historical period than for elevated $\mathrm{CO_2}$ is also a reason for the
  overestimation of volcanic cooling by the TCRP in HadCM3, although less important than
  ocean heat uptake and volcanic forcing (could be due to difference in forcing nature
  or that the sensitivity depends on $\mathrm{CO_2}$ concentration)
- A large ensemble is needed to precisely evaluate $\alpha$
- Would be useful for the investigation of volcanic forcing and feedback in CMIP6 if
  ensemble experiments had only historical aerosol forcing, to diagnose the climate
  response. Further, with AGCMs with prescribed sea surface conditions, to diagnose the
  radiative forcing.
  - _Do other models also exhibit a cloud adjustment and a lower climate sensitivity for
    volcanic forcing?_

- Uncertainties in $\Delta T_{(t)}^{\mathrm{Vol}}$ are larger than what was reported by
  Johansson et al. (2015).
- El Niño in the 1980- and 90s masks cooling from El Chichón and Pinatubo and hamper
  reliable estimation of the true cooling signal.
- Concerning Johansson et al. infer a posterior average estimate of $F^{\mathrm{Pn}}$
  that is substantially smaller than that obtained from observations.

> DOI: [10.5194/esd-7-133-2016](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-133-2016)

- One study suggested that volcanic forcing never equilibrates (too little time in
  between eruptions, eruptions occur over all observed timescales)
- Volcanic forcings were seen to be strong at annual scales but decreasing ($H<0$) while
  the solar forcing was small at annual scales and increasing ($H>0$)

### 2016 — Rypdal and Rypdal: Late Quaternary temperature variability described as abrupt transitions on a $1/f$ noise background

> DOI: [10.5194/esd-7-281-2016](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-281-2016)

- The $1/f$ noise characterization of the temporal fluctuations in global mean surface
  temperature is robust — accurate for the Holocene climate
- Processes that exhibit power-law structure functions and strictly concave scaling
  functions can be characterized as multifractal intermittent
- For a monofractal (monoscaling) process, the scaling function is linear in
- The analysis gives no evidence of multifractal intermittency in the temperature
  records
- Multifractal intermittency implies that amplitudes of random fluctuations are
  clustered in time on all timescales (e.g., intermittent turbulence). This is not
  observed here, most reasonably modelled as monofractals

> DOI: [10.5194/esd-7-597-2016](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-597-2016)

- The question is not whether non-linearities are present in the Zebiak-Cane or GCM
  models (it is), but whether these non-linearities are detectable in the global
  temperature response
- No reason why responses should be more linear on short than on long timescales, in
  particular not the response to burst-like volcanic forcing

- “But even more pressing is the debates about fair contributions for each country in
  reducing emissions, helping others to do so, and adapt, and the lack of willingness to
  step up and lead the pack.”
- Discrepancy and lack of progress? Models favour ECS in the upper part of the “likely”
  range.
- A big concern is that many climate models share the same limitations, the same
  imperfect observations
- Clouds are the largest uncertainty feedback
- Easier to produce a model with good performance on mean climate and a climate
  sensitivity above the IPCC range
- Uncertainties also in observations, making even multidecadal trends uncertain
- _Most pressing issue:_ Growing concern that a single constant climate feedback
  parameter (λ) is unrealistic. Neglects differences in the temperature response to
  forcing that are not captured by a forcing efficacy.
- Therefore, ECS also (including TCR) depends strongly on ocean heat uptake and
  circulation response
- Forcings may not be additive, but depend on the type and magnitude of the forcing
- ECS estimates assuming a constant λ are probably underestimates

> DOI: [10.5194/gmd-11-2633-2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2633-2018)

- A good resource for what processes affect and are affected by volcanic eruptions
- An intercomparison revealed that modelled volcanic sulphate deposition varies
  substantially in timing, spatial pattern, and magnitude between the models
- Still, no clear understanding of which model is closer to reality in describing the
  stratospheric aerosol distribution
- Even with a fine aerosol size resolution, resulting sedimentation can be biased due to
  the model’s numerical scheme
- There is rising interest among the climate community in global models with interactive
  aerosol microphysics, partly because of the unclear role of major and smaller
  volcanoes in the future climate (e.g., Bethke et al., 2017; Klobas et al., 2017)
- Initially, SAGE II data experience a saturation effect, and HIRS data is better to
  use, but as the atmosphere becomes sufficiently transparent it is expected that SAGE
  II measurements provide more accurate aerosol extinction
- Lower tropical stratospheric warming after major volcanic eruptions is one of the key
  features of volcanic influence on climate
- Numerically diffusive methods must be avoided
