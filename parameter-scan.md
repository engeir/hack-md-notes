This note first looks into how the three different forcing strengths alter the
temperature signal. That is if we normalize and do not care about the amplitude of the
signals, does the temperature show a similar shape across all three forcing strengths?

## Individual without normalization

We may first have a look at what the ensemble median and the 5th to 95th percentiles
look like.
