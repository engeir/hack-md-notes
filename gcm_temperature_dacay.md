## Raw data

The below plot is showing a control run, three different single-event runs with
differently sized volcanic forcing, and a double-event run where the two volcanoes are
both of the same size as the middle single-event volcano.

Let us have a different look at this where we average over each year:

The temperature clearly do not revert to equilibrium for the medium and large volcanoes,
even a decade after the volcanic eruption.

## Forcing size and comparing to historical eruptions

Let us further compare the size of the volcanic forcing to some historical eruptions,
just to get a feel for the likelihood of them happening or if they are completely
unrealistic.

The below show _total aerosol optical depth in visible band_ corresponding to the
simulations above.
