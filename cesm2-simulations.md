All the different CESM2 simulations that are (to be) done are:

- Control run
- Single volcano, three different magnitudes, one per season
- Double volcanoes, four year separation, medium magnitude
- Single volcano, high latitude (56 degree north), strong magnitude, two seasons

| Type                          | Ensemble size | Length |
| :---------------------------- | ------------: | -----: |
| Control                       |             1 |      9 |
| Single volcano                |             4 |   9-24 |
| Double volcanoes              |             1 |     30 |
| Single volcano, high latitude |             2 |     24 |

For each, the aerosol optical depth is shown from the `fSST` simulations, and reference
height global mean temperature is shown from the full `BWma1850` simulations.

## Control runs

One simulation.
