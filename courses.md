| ==752==, Inverse Methods in Atmospheric Science                   | ==2 (2 0 0)==, PhD standing in ATS or written permission of instructor | Provides an introduction to inverse modeling, with application to remote sensing retrievals, flux inversions, and data assimilation                                                                                                        | Fall even years | Not so relevant?                                                        |
