# Double Volcanic Event

## Smoothing

Let us first have a look at the raw reference temperature output:

...

The smoothing is done by subtracting a pure sinusoid (amplitude of the sinusoid found by
trial and error, what looked best) and by removing frequencies around one from the
Fourier domain.

## Forcing

We may have a closer look at the forcing as well. Here we see the total aerosol optical depth in visible band:

## Superposition

Finally, let us grab one of the single event simulations and try to add it to itself
with an appropriate shift in time, to see how close we get to the double event
simulation.
